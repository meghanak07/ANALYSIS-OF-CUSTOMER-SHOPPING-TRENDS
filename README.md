# ANALYSIS-OF-CUSTOMER-SHOPPING-TRENDS
The Analysis of Customer Shopping Trends project aims to design and develop a comprehensive system to analyze and identify customer shopping trends and patterns. The project involves creating a system that can efficiently collect, store, and analyze customer data to provide insights on shopping behavior, preferences, and trends.

Project Objectives:

Design a system to collect and store customer data, including transaction history, demographics, and shopping behavior.
Develop a data analytics platform to analyze customer data and identify shopping trends and patterns.
Implement data visualization tools to provide insights on customer shopping behavior, preferences, and trends.
Develop predictive models to forecast future shopping trends and preferences.
Functional Requirements:

Data Collection: The system should collect customer data from various sources, including point-of-sale systems, online transactions, and customer surveys.
Data Storage: The system should store customer data in a scalable and secure database.
Data Analytics: The system should analyze customer data using machine learning algorithms and statistical models to identify shopping trends and patterns.
Data Visualization: The system should provide data visualization tools to present insights on customer shopping behavior, preferences, and trends.
Predictive Modeling: The system should develop predictive models to forecast future shopping trends and preferences.
Non-Functional Requirements:

Security: The system should ensure data security and integrity by implementing access controls, encryption, and secure data storage.
Scalability: The system should be designed to handle large volumes of customer data, with the ability to scale up or down as needed.
Usability: The system should provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for analysts and business users.
Technical Requirements:

Database Management System: The system should use a relational database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
Programming Language: The system should be developed using a programming language, such as Python or R.
Data Analytics Framework: The system should use a data analytics framework, such as Apache Spark or Hadoop.
Data Visualization Tools: The system should use data visualization tools, such as Tableau or Power BI.
